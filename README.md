# Face-Mask-Detection-using-CNN
Introduction:

The global COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated the adoption of safety measures to curb the spread of the virus. One such measure is the mandatory use of face masks when venturing outside. In response to this requirement, the application of deep learning in face mask detection has gained significant traction. This project focuses on developing a robust face mask detection model trained on a dataset containing 7,553 RGB images, with the primary goal of accurately distinguishing between faces with and without masks.

Problem Statement:

The Face Mask Detection project addresses the imperative need for an automated system capable of identifying individuals wearing face masks versus those without masks. The dataset, comprising 7,553 images, is categorized into two folders: "with_mask" and "without_mask." The images depict individuals in various scenarios, presenting the model with diverse challenges in recognizing masked and unmasked faces.
